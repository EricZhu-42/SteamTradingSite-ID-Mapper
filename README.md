<h1 align="center">SteamTradingSite ID Mapper</h1>

This repository provides an ID mapping for DOTA2 & CS2 tradeable items between the Steam Market and major trading platforms. 

该仓库旨在提供 DOTA2 & CS2 在 Steam Market 与主要的第三方交易平台的饰品 ID 对照表，以便于相关程序的开发。

Currently, we support the following platforms:

- [BUFF](https://buff.163.com/)
- [IGXE](https://www.igxe.cn/)
- [C5](https://www.c5game.com/)
- [UUYP](https://www.youpin898.com/) (youpin898.com)

Please note that we cannot guarantee the completeness, accuracy, or timeliness of the mapping as new items are continuously added to the games. Contributions are always welcome!

请注意，由于游戏中将不断添加新的饰品，我们无法保证对照关系的完整性、正确性与时效性。欢迎发起 PR 进行更新！
